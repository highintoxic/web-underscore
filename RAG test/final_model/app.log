By the time they approach an Ayurvedic doctor for treatment, the disease has often reached a chronic state, making treatment more challenging.

In terms of specific actions taken by these patients, it is recommended that they:

1. Drink enough water/liquid every day.
2. Eat enough seasonal vegetables and fruit.
3. Avoid vegetarian food, fatty, fast food/junk food diets.

Additionally, Ayurvedic treatment approaches for Kushta patients involve various therapies, such as Shodhana, Nasya, Vamana, and Virechana, which are tailored to the specific imbalance of Dosha-Dushya Avastha.
